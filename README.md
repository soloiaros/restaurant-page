In this project, I tried to apply my knowledge on JavaScript's ES6 Modules and bundling with the use of... Webpack 🔷


## 🔖 So.. what're the features?

Even though the page itself is pretty basic, I took a different approach this time. The switch between tabs happens due to triggering certain JS modules, in a single HTML file. 

Basically, whenever you click a tab-switching button, the DOM gets wiped clean and populated again with the appropriate content.

(also, the majority of the content is loaded from JSON files, which was also pretty new to me particularly when working with web applications).
